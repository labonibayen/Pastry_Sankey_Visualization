# About

An interactive visualization of desserts, the type of pastry neededed to make each dessert, and the dessert's country of origin. This is a Django App built in a Digital Ocean droplet, and uses D3 for the sankey diagram.

Hovering over the a dessert or a base pastry reveals a tooltip with a brief description.
Hovering over a link increases its opacity, helping the individual link stand out amongst the rest of the connections.
