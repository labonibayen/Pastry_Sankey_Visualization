# django_sankey
A Django web app to visualize many to many relationships through a sankey diagram. This is a three tier sankey diagram built using d3-sankey. The interactive diagram is a proof of concept filled with randomly generated junk data.

Hovering over the nodes reveal tooltips with descriptions.
Hovering over a link increases its opacity, helping the individual link stand out amongst the rest of the connections.
