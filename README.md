# django_sankey
A Django web app to visualize many to many relationships. A three tier sankey diagram built using d3-sankey.
Hovering over the nodes reveal tooltips with descriptions.
Hovering over a link increases its opacity, helping the individual link stand out amongst the rest of the connections.
